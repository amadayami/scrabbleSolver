## How to use the program

### Word solver

Planned: pass in the dictionary through command line arguments
and user provides board and tray through standard input. Files are
processed and related objects are created. Vertical and horizontal
searches are conducted through a series of cross checks and anagram
creations. The final chosen word is printed to the console.

### GUI Scrabble

Planned: Player clicks a tile and a board space, placing the tile on
the selected space. Once player signals they are done with choosing
and placement, then the word is checked for existence in the dictionary.
If it does, then the computer would choose a word and pass play.

## Known Issues

### Word Solvers

Not completed, does not do anything properly

### GUI Scrabble

Does not exist, only have the pieces that would make it work
